Project Description
The Hotel Booking System is a software application designed to manage hotel room reservations and related operations efficiently. The system allows guests to view available rooms, make bookings, and manage their reservations online, while hotel staff handle check-ins, check-outs, and room assignments. Administrators and managers can manage users, room details, pricing, and generate operational reports. The system aims to reduce manual work, prevent double bookings, and improve overall customer experience and hotel management efficiency.
